#Typing Speed Test
This is a Python script that tests your typing speed and accuracy. It randomly generates a sentence and measures how fast and accurately you can type it.

Dependencies
The script uses the following libraries:

curses: for the terminal user interface.
nltk: for generating the random sentences using English words.

How to Run
The script is a standalone Python script. You can run it directly from the terminal:

python typing_speed_test.py

After running the script, you will be presented with a randomly generated sentence. Type this sentence as fast and accurately as you can. The script will measure your typing speed in words per minute and your accuracy.

User Interface
The user interface uses different colors to highlight the sentence, your input, and any typing errors. The color scheme is as follows:

Green: The sentence to be typed.
Blue: The letters you type correctly.
Red: The letters you type incorrectly.
The interface also provides instructions and results of the typing test.

Notes
The script measures typing speed in words per minute, where a word is assumed to be 5 characters long. This is a common standard in typing speed tests.

The script uses the NLTK corpus of English words to generate the sentences, so it requires an internet connection for the first run.
